# On Recurrent Neural Networks for Sequence-based Processing in Communications
## In this notebook we show how to build a decoder for convolutional codes based on recurrent neural networks
Accompanying code of paper ["On Recurrent Neural Networks for Sequence-based Processing in Communications" by Daniel Tandler, Sebastian DÃ¶rner, Sebastian Cammerer, Stephan ten Brink](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9048728)

## Installation/Setup

An example of the used code is given in the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file), the coding.py file is just for arbitrary code generation and not required to run the notebook.

You can directly run the notebook with code and short explanations in google colab:
